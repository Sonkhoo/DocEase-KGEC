## Overview

**DocEase-KGEC** is a modular platform providing solutions for secure document management, healthcare applications, and Web3 integrations. The repository is organized into multiple sub-projects, each catering to a different aspect of document security, frontend user experience, healthcare data management, and blockchain-powered features.

## Features

- **Document Management:** Secure storage, sharing, and retrieval of documents.
- **Healthcare Application:** Patient and medical record management (`medapp`).
- **Frontend:** Modern interfaces for users and administrators (`frontend`, `client`).
- **Web3 Integration:** Blockchain-powered document verification and decentralized data handling (`web3`, `web3_2`).
- **Backend Services:** RESTful APIs and server-side logic (`server`, `python`).
- **Multi-language Support:** TypeScript (main), Python for specialized backend services.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Easily add modules or features for custom use cases.
